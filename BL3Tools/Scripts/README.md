All of these scripts utilize the BL3 [PythonSDK](https://github.com/bl-sdk/PythonSDK).
It's currently **in development** and available in the [bl3](https://github.com/bl-sdk/PythonSDK/tree/bl3) branch.
You will need to join the Discord in order to get support for it or DM me on Discord (@FromDarkHell#8008).
