### Installation / Usage

1. Download the [7zip](https://7-zip.org) file on the [Releases](https://github.com/somefunguy/TTWLSaveEditor/releases) tab.
2. Extract the [7zip](https://7-zip.org) file to a folder of your choosing.
3. Run TTWSaveEditor.exe
4. Click `Open`, then you can select either a profile (`profile.sav`) or a game save (`[NUMBERS].sav`).
5. You can now edit your profile or game save to your hearts content!
6. Once you think you're done editing your saves, you can save your file with either the `Save` button (which will overwrite your loaded file), or use the `Save As` button, allowing you to save to a new file. In either case, it will make backups to help keep your saves protected!

### Credits

- [FromDarkHell](https://github.com/fromdarkhell/) for creating the original BL3 editor, which this project has been entirely built upon and would not be possible without.
- Arwent for transforming the FDH BL3 editor to work with Wonderlands.
- [GreenLamp](https://github.com/Greenlamp2/) for continuing and adding many things to Arwent's work.
- [gibbed](https://github.com/Gibbed) for their [Inventory Serial Number Database](https://github.com/gibbed/WonderlandsDumps). It's what allows me to know what weapons you've got in your backpack! I also use their [WonderlandsProtos](https://github.com/gibbed/WonderlandsProtos) repository
- [apocalyptech](https://github.com/apocalyptech/) for writing the incredibly helpful [guide](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/wiki/Understanding-BL3-Item-Serial-Numbers) on parsing weapon serials.
- [Benjamin Ruhl](https://github.com/benruehl) for creating [AdonisUI](https://github.com/benruehl/adonis-ui), the WPF toolkit I used for most of my UI development/theming.
- [xceed software](https://github.com/xceedsoftware) for creating the [Extended WPF Toolkit](https://github.com/xceedsoftware/wpftoolkit), allowing me to have a `Raw` tab and number up/downs.
- [Gearbox Software](https://www.gearboxsoftware.com/) of course for creating Wonderlands.
- Many others who helped test the editor as well as help me get my mind around some of the concepts.
